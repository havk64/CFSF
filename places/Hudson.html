<p>The French presence in California coincides roughly with the beginning of the Spanish presence. A large number of French Canadians were already operating in California as trappers, guides, and ranchers during the Spanish then Mexican periods of rule. Unfortunately their presence was poorly documented so no meaningful estimates of their numbers can been established. We can however gain insight by focus on the contingent operating the Yerba Buena post of the Hudson’s Bay Company. In the 1840s, the area of the city where the financial district now stands, was known as Yerba Buena. At the time, “San Francisco” referred specifically to the Presidio area and its mission.</p>

<p>You will see that this plaque mentions the presence of the post and its Anglo-Canadian commander. The story unmentioned behind that simplification is the predominant role played by French-Canadians. </p>

<p>In 1841 Governor McLoughlin of the Hudson’s Bay Company arrived in what would become San Francisco with a party from the company’s regional headquarters on the Columbia River. The francophone McLoughlin was born in Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec to a French Canadian mother. In Oregon he later married a French Canadian metis woman named Marguerite. One of their francophone children ended up marrying William Rae. The employees of the Hudson’s Bay Company were predominantly French speaking Canadians, most of whom were also mixed blood metis.</p>


<p>McLoughlin’s intent was to establish a new post for the company. On behalf of the company the party purchased a portion of land from a landowner named Mr. Leese. The land purchased compromised the easterly two thirds of the block that is today bounded by Kearny, Sacramento, Clay and Montgomery Streets, and included a large wooden two-story building that had been occupied by Leese and his family. The price paid for the property was $4,800, half in coin and half in goods. Two weeks later McLoughlin departed and shortly thereafter his son-in-law William G. Rae arrived, with his francophone wife and children, to take over and develop the post. The post’s economic activity was primarily accomplished by sending out their little launches and schooners to collect hides and tallow about the bay. This proved to be good business until the death of Rae in January, 1845. </p>

<p>At the time, the other third of the block containing the Hudson’s Bay store was owned by the francophone Swiss John J. Vioget. Vioget was an interesting character. After serving in the French Army under Napoleon, he served in the Brazilian Navy before making his way to Yerba Buena in 1839.</p>

<p>When Vioget arrived, the only buildings were the Leese and Richardson family homes. The Mexican authorities contracted Vioget to produce the first survey of Yerba Buena, which can be viewed through this link (http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb1489n6kp/). Vioget received a land grant as payment for his survey work. Vioget decided to build a saloon on his new land, which featured a billiard room. Up until the gold rush, Vioget’s establishment offered the only entertainment in town for the visiting captains, merchants, and clerks of the HBC trading post. </p>

<p>Vioget then went to do survey work for his fellow Swiss emigrant Johann Sutter. Vioget surveyed Sutter's Sacramento-area land grants in 1841 and 1843. Vioget also served as a witness to Sutter's purchase of Fort Ross from the Russians in December 1841. Vioget later functioned as Sutter's agent in San Francisco. </p>

<On January 24th 1848 gold was discovered on Johann Sutter’s land, and the California Gold Rush was on. Some historians claim that it was actually the French Canadian trapper Jean-Baptiste Ruelle who made the initial discovery while working for Sutter. Unfortunately for the HBC, they had just closed their trading post in Yerba Buena due to its ongoing questionable commercial viability</p>.

<p>The following month France experienced a popular uprising, which became a full revolution as the constitutional monarchy of Louis-Philippe was deposed. As the instability in France pushed many towards emigration, the news of the discovery of gold in California also pulled them towards a better opportunity abroad. These two simultaneous phenomenon combined and lead to an estimated 20 to 40 thousand French immigrants arriving in San Francisco (Yerba Buena) to try their luck in the Gold Rush. The French government actually encouraged the emigration of these malcontents with subsidies paid to the companies that organized lotteries for passage to San Francisco. (1)</p>

<p>French speaking Canadiens also represented an additional 4 to 5 thousand French speaking arrivals during the Gold Rush (2). This group represented emigrants not only from Quebec but also significant numbers from existing French speaking communities in the American Midwest and other parts of the West. These two North American French communities had been disconnected in the aftermath of the French and Indian War, but came back into contact 100 years later in San Francisco as a result of the Gold Rush!</p>

<p>The majority of these new immigrants continued inland towards Sacramento and the gold mines, but a sizable number remained in San Francisco. In fact, the population of San Francisco went from 500 residents in 1847 to 21,000 three years later. The largest concentration was on Montgomery and Commercial Streets, and the area became known as a “French town” (where you are currently walking).</p>

<p>In this San Francisco Frenchtown district, francophone service businesses accompanied the influx of population. This demand lead to the opening of French language schools, law firms, banks, barbers, restaurants, a hospital, and even a professional French theater. The community also organized itself politically. In 1849 a representative for the French community was named to the municipal government. The following year the French government sent a consul to San Francisco.</p>

<p>Like today, during the gold rush French Canadians were a minority compared to their European French cousins. However, since most of the French Canadians were bilingual, many served as valuable interpreters, a function they often served throughout the American West. These French groups still shared the same catholic faith as well as 12 regional French language papers throughout Northern California.</p>

<p>What then remains of this period of immense French demographic, cultural and economic presence in San Francisco?</p>
