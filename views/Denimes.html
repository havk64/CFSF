                Levi Strauss opened his first store at 90 Sacramento Street (See point 5 on the map) in 1853. Levi Strauss was a young German immigrant who decided to follow the gold rush to San Francisco. His original plan was to open a new branch of his brother’s dry goods business in New York. Strauss was selling rough canvas for tents and wagon covers when prospectors began complaining of a shortage of reliable pants. Levi Strauss responded by converting the canvas into waist overalls but the material was too coarse. The solution was to substitute a twilled cotton cloth from France called “serge de Nîmes” (Nîmes is a city in southern France). This evolved into the name “denim”, also known as blue jeans.
